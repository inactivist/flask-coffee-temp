This is a temporary clone of the MIT-licensed [Flask-Coffee] flask
extension described in this [article], because for some reason I can't
access the [original repo][original] no matter what I've
tried.  (I admit I didn't try very hard.)

I don't plan on doing much with this repo.  It's just here so the code
is *easily* visible via a public git hosting service.

*I've encouraged the original author, Col Wilson, to move
(or clone) his repo to Github.*
