This is a temporary clone of the MIT-licensed [Flask-Coffee] flask extension, because for some
reason I can't access the [original repo][original] no matter what I've
tried.

I don't plan on doing much with this repo.  It's just here so the code
is visible via a public git hosting service.

This is a public plea to the original author, Col Wilson, to move (or clone) his repo
to Github.  Please.  The current hosting on bettercodes.org is an impediment.
